# Coding Bootcamp Week 2: Homework #2 - Portfolio

This is the personal portfolio of Ryan Lee.

Originally created for UCSD's Coding Bootcamp's homework #2.

The objective of this homework is to use all the things I've learned so far in the bootcamp, including Advanced HTML and CSS, (such as media querties, and flex boxes) and to create a portfolio from scratch.

This portfolio has been created by me, with some inspiration from various websites I have seen before. I have done, to the best of my abilities to meet the acceptence criteria.

After the homework, I hope and plan to keep this updated for my own personal uses.
